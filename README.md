# Unity ML-Agents

This project has as goal to use the ML-Agents library from Unity game engine in order to build the digital twin of a manufacturing facility where materials have to be delivered from the storage section till all the manufacturing stations. This will be done applying reinforcement learning and swarm intelligence concepts so that the agents autonomously lear where everything has to be delivered in the most efficient manner.
